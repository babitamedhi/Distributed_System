Lamport Clock Simulation
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Lamport Clock algorithm, a logical clock system for distributed systems. Lamport clocks help maintain causal ordering of events across multiple processes in a distributed environment by assigning logical timestamps to each event.

Features
Lamport Clock Class: A LamportClock class representing individual processes, each with its own logical clock.
Event Simulation: Demonstrates internal, send, and receive events across processes.
Causal Ordering: Ensures the correct logical order of events when messages are passed between processes.
How to Use
Run the Simulation: Execute the code to see how Lamport clocks update as events occur in the processes.
Test Function: The test_lamport_clock function provides a sample sequence of events among three processes, showing how clocks are synchronized upon each send and receive event.
Getting Started
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Run the main code or the test function to observe Lamport Clock behavior:
bash
Copy code
python your_file_name.py
Example Output
The output displays clock values for each process as they send and receive messages, demonstrating how the Lamport algorithm maintains causality in a distributed system.
